# CryptoBook

## About this project

CryptoBook is a community project, developed by members of [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org) to create a resource for people to learn cryptography. The focus of this project is to create a friendly resource for the mathematical fundamentals of cryptography, along with corresponding [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) implementation.

Think of this as an alternative SageMath documentation source, where the focus is its application in solving cryptographic problems.
