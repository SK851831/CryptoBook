# Rings

A set$$R$$with two binary operations $$+,\cdot:R\times R\to R$$is a **ring** if the following holds:

* $$R,+$$is a commutative group with identity $$0$$
* $$R,\cdot$$is a monoid \(group without the inverse axiom\) with identity$$1$$.
* Distributivity: $$a(b+c)=ab+ac,(a+b)c=ac+bc$$

// ideals, diff types of domains
