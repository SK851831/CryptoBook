# Sample Page

### Introduction

Give a description of the topic, and what you hope the reader will get from this. For example, this page will cover addition of the natural numbers. Talk about how this relates to something in cryptography, either through a protocol, or an attack. This can be a single sentence, or verbose.

### Addition

For all natural numbers, the addition operation is

* Associative: $$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$$
* Commutative: $$a + b = b + a$$
* Distributive: $$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$

###  Interesting Identity

$$
(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \ldots + n^3
$$

### Sage Example

```python
sage: 1 + (2 + 3) == (1 + 2) + 3
True
sage: 1 + 2 == 2 + 1
True
sage: 5*(7 + 11) == 5*7 + 5*11
True
```
