# Isogeny and Ramanujan Graphs

{% hint style="danger" %}
**I \(Jack\) know nothing about this. At all. But it will need to be talked about.**
{% endhint %}

* Isogeny graph \(general definition, degree, duals...\).
* Starting vertex \(Br√∂ker's algorithm\).
* Isogeny Volcanos: Sutherland might be a good source [https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5370](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5370).
* Supersingular isogeny graphs
  * Size, everything is defined over GF\(p^2\). \(\*as long as the degree divides \(p+1\)^2 or \(p-1\)^2\).
  * Random walks are probably the best motivation to define Ramanujanness, and are directly applicable to cryptography. A \(perhaps too large\) source is Hoory-Linial-Wigderson.
  * Consequence from Ramanujan + random walk convergence: O\(log p\) diameter.
