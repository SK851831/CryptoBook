# Introduction to Isogeny Cryptography

Making this section as a motivation to make sure this is part of the book. Something to work towards.

## Page Plan

* Describe that there is a drive towards post-quantum algorithms
* The incredible fact that paths within isogeny graphs commute \(with the help of torsion points\)
* Supersingular $$\ell$$ isogeny graphs are $$(\ell + 1)$$regular Ramanujan graphs
* Using paths through these graphs has spawned a whole bunch of protocols
  * SIKE / BIKE / ...
  * Hashes
  * ...
* First we will look at the fundementals that allow these protocols to be expected as good candidates for post-quantum
* Then we look at these protocols in more detail. Hopefully with SageMath implementations for each
