# Style Guide

* Make sure all code blocks have the right language selected for syntax highlighting
* All maths must be presented using $$\LaTeX$$using both block and inline
* Try and use the hints / tips blocks to break up dense text

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: To use Latex, you can wrap your text in `$$maths here$$.` If this is at the beginning of a paragraph, it makes it block, otherwise it is inline
{% endhint %}

* We want to have SageMath examples whenever possible, however one author can contribute this on a page with theory written by someone else
* Will add more here when I can...
