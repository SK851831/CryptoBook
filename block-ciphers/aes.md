# AES

## Introduction

The Advanced Encryption Standard most known as AES is one of the most used ciphers nowadays.  
Created by Vinent Rijmen and Joan Daemen under the name \*Rijndael\*, it won the NIST competition that resulted in its standardization in 2001 to replaced older algorithms such as DES \(and its variant 3DES\).

In this page we first present an overall description of AES for a general understanding, and as we progress further details of its inner working will be explored.
