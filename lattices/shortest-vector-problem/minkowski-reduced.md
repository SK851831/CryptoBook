# Minkowski reduced

## Definition

The basis$$\left\{b_i\right\}_{i=1}^d$$ is **Minkowski-reduced** if $$b_i$$has minimum length among all vectors in $$L$$ linearly independent from$$\left\{b_j\right\}_{j=1}^{i-1}$$. Equivalently, $$b_i$$has minimum length among all vectors $$v$$such that $$\left\{b_1,\dots,b_{i-1},v\right\}$$can be extended to form a basis of$$L$$. Such a notion is strongest among all lattice reduction notions and is generally extremely hard to compute.

## Bounds

$$
\lambda_i(L)^2\leq||b_i||^2\leq\min\left\{1,\left(\frac54\right)^{i-4}\right\}\lambda_i(L)^2
$$
