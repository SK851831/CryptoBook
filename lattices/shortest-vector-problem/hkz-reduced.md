# HKZ reduced

## Definition

Let $$\pi_i$$as the projection to the orthogonal complement of $$\left\{b_j\right\}_{j=1}^{i-1}$$.Then the basis is **HKZ-reduced** if it is size-reduced and $$||b_i^*||=\lambda_1\left(\pi_i(L)\right)$$. This definition gives us a relatively simple way to compute a HKZ-reduced basis by iteratively finding the shortest vector in orthogonal projections.

## Bounds

$$
\frac4{i+3}\leq\left(\frac{||b_i||}{\lambda_i(L)}\right)^2\leq\frac{i+3}4
$$
