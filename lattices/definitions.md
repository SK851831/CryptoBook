# Introduction

Lattices, also known as Minkowski's theory after Hermann Minkowski or the geometry of numbers \(deprecated!\) allows the usage of geometrical tools \(i.e. volumes\) in number theory.

The intuitive notion of a lattice \(perhaps surprisingly\) matches its mathematical definition. For example, lattices are formed by

* the points on an infinite checkerboard;
* the centers of a hexagonal tessellation;
* the integers on the real number line.

The last example should hint at how we generalize this concept to arbitrary dimensions. In general, lattices consist of discrete points which appear at "regular intervals." These ideas are succinctly codified by the formal definition.

### Definitions and results

Given basis vectors, the lattice generated by $$v_i$$is the subgroup of $$\mathbb R^n$$ of the form

A **lattice** $$L$$ is a subgroup of $$\mathbb R^n$$of the form

$$
\mathbb Zv_1+\mathbb Zv_2+\dots+\mathbb Zv_m=\left\{\left.\sum_{i=1}^na_iv_i\right|a_i\in\mathbb Z\right\}
$$

where $$v_i$$are linearly independent vectors. $$v_1,v_2,\dots,v_m$$is known as a basis for $$L$$. The **dimension** of the lattice, $$\dim L$$, is $$m$$ and the region

$$
\Phi=\left\{\left.\sum_{i=1}^nx_iv_i\right|0\leq x_i<1\right\}
$$

is known as the **fundamental mesh**. A lattice is **complete** if $$m=n$$. Note that we can always choose a subspace of $$\mathbb R^n$$such that the lattice is complete, namely the subspace generated by $$v_i$$.

In the image above, we see the points of a lattice in $$\mathbb R^2$$. The red vectors are one set of basis vectors and the shaded region is the corresponding fundamental mesh. The green vectors also form another set of basis vectors with its corresponding fundamental mesh. We see here that the basis vectors and fundamental mesh is not unique to a lattice.

Although the fundamental mesh is not unique, it turns out that the \($$m$$dimensional\) volume of the fundamental mesh is constant for any given lattice. Hence we can define the **volume** of a lattice as the volume of a fundamental mesh. However this definition can be hard to handle hence we provide an equivalent definition via determinants:

Let $$\mathcal B$$be a $$m$$by $$n$$matrix whose rows are given by the basis vectors. Then the volume of a fundemental mesh is given by

$$
\text{vol}(L)=\det\left(\mathcal B\mathcal B^T\right)
$$

A subset $$X$$of $$\mathbb R^n$$is known as **centrally symmetric** if $$x\in X$$implies $$-x\in X$$. It is convex if for any $$x,y\in X$$, the line joining $$x,y$$ is contained in $$X$$, i.e. $$\left\{tx+(1-t)y|0\leq t\leq1\right\}\subset X$$. Finally we can introduce the most important theorem about lattices, the **Minkowski's Lattice Point Theorem**:

Let $$L$$be a complete lattice and $$X$$be a centrally symmetric convex set. Suppose

$$
\text{vol}(X)>2^n\text{vol}(L)
$$

Then $$X$$contains at one nonzero point of $$L $$. This result is primarily used to prove the existence of lattice vectors.
